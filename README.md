# 🛠️ LAMP Chat Sandbox **Tsatti**

## 📚 Project Purpose

This project is a hands-on learning sandbox designed to explore and internalize key concepts in web development and agile collaboration. It’s not about building a perfect product—it's about building understanding through experimentation, iteration, and duct tape.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

1. **GitHub Fundamentals**
   - Understand GitHub workflows, including branching, pull requests, and merge approvals.
   - Learn how to navigate GitHub’s restrictions and permissions in collaborative environments.

2. **Agile Development**
   - Practice agile rituals like sprint planning, issue tracking, and iterative delivery.
   - Use GitHub Projects and Issues to simulate real-world team workflows.

3. **LAMP Stack Exploration**
   - Learn the basics of **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **PHP**.
   - Deploy and manage a simple web app on a Linux-based server using Apache and MySQL.

4. **Build a Chat Web App (No Webhooks!)**
   - Create a rudimentary chat interface using classic web technologies.
   - Explore alternative methods for live user interaction without relying on webhooks.

5. **Server & Stack Management**
   - Learn how to configure, run, and maintain a LAMP stack.
   - Understand deployment, file structure, and basic security practices.
